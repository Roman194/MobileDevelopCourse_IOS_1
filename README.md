# MobileDevelopCourse_IOS_1
It's my first project on Swift language. <br />
I 've made only 3 first screens from Figma but with :<br />
- volume project structure <br />
- without design-system hardcode<br />
- data models and their example info<br />
- numeral and text constants<br />
- accessibility support<br />
- pixel perfect<br />
<br />
You can see the sceenshots from IPhone SE and Iphone 12 simulators respectively below:
